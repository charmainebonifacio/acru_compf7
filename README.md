# The ACRU-Hydro-Climatological Data File Generator

This macro is used append solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed and sunshine hour observed data into the original 10K Daily Gridded Dataset by Hutchinson (2009) in order to calculate daily reference evapotranspiration using the Penman-Monteith equation.

## Context
The verification of streamflow is key calibration process. The purpose of this macro is to automate the post-processing of all ACRU output files after each run in order to introduce human-error and expedite the verification process.
